infusion_superior: "Infusion (Superior)"
infusion_superior_description: |
  You are able to fly. In addition to the obvious advantages in mobility,
  your melee attacks can target flying creatures and you cannot be targeted by melee attacks
  unless the attacker is flying or is somehow able to reach flying targets.

  These benefits do not apply if you are unable to fly freely (such as when inside a vehicle
  designed for human-sized creatures, or in a narrow corridor).

  Additionally, when you suffer **air**, **lightning** or **ice** damage during a conflict scene,
  you lose these benefits until the start of your next turn.
