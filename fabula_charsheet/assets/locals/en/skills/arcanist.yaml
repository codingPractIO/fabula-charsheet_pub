skill_bind_and_summon_description: |
  You may bind **Arcana** to your soul and summon them later. The Game Master will tell you the details of each binding process when you first encounter the **Arcanum** in question.  
  
  You may use an action and spend **40** Mind Points (MP) to summon an **Arcanum** you have bound.  

  If you take this skill at character creation, you begin play with one **Arcanum** of your choice already bound to you.
  Other than that, you may only obtain new **Arcana** through exploration and story progression.
