  At the start of your turn during a conflict, you may choose a weapon **Category** other than **brawling**.  
  If you do, your **unarmed strikes** now belong to the chosen **Category**.  

  If you choose **bow**, **firearm**, or **thrown**, they become **ranged weapons** instead of **melee**.  
  If you choose **dagger** or **sword**, they cannot be used with **Triple Slash**.
