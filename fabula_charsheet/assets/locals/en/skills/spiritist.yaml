  if you have an **arcane** weapon equipped, you may choose one of those allies you have a **Bond** towards.

skill_vismagus_description: |
  When you cast a spell, if you don't have enough Mind Points to pay for its total cost,  
  you may choose to spend **twice as many **Hit Points instead.  

  You cannot use this skill if doing so would reduce you to 0 Hit Points.  
  If a spell cast this way would cause you to recover Hit Points, you instead recover no Hit Points 
  (the spell functions normally on any other target).
