  You get a total budget of 500 zenit to purchase equipment with. By default, you can only purchase basic weapons and basic armor and shields; these items are listed on the next four pages for easy reference. If you want to purchase rare items (page 266) or transports (page 125), discuss it with the rest of your group.

  To purchase a martial (♦️) item, you must first be able to equip it — a benefit granted by specific Classes.

  Needless to say, you are free to alter the name of any item that doesn't fit your character's concept — for instance, your bronze sword might become a scimitar or your silk vest might become a kimono.
