    description: >
      When another creature is threatened by an attack, spell or other danger, you may take
      their place (any Checks that are part of the danger will be performed against you; you
      may declare the use of this Skill before or after the Checks have been made). If the
      danger already affected you, it affects you twice (resolve both instances separately);
      you also cannot protect multiple creatures from the same danger. If you use this Skill
      during a conflict, you cannot use it again until the start of your next turn.
