      When you cast a spell that targets one or more allies, if you have an arcane weapon equipped,
      you may choose one of those allies you have a Bond towards. If you do, that ally gains a bonus
      to the next Check they perform during the current scene; this bonus is equal to the strength
      of your Bond towards them.

      When you cast a spell, if you don't have enough Mind Points to pay for its total cost,
      you may choose to spend twice as many Hit Points instead. You cannot use this Skill if doing
      so would reduce you to 0 Hit Points. If a spell cast this way would cause you to recover Hit Points,
      you instead recover no Hit Points (the spell functions normally on any other target).
