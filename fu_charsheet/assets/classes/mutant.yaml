  - name: mutant unarmed mastery
    description: >
      Your unarmed strikes deal【6 + (SL × 2)】extra damage, and you gain a bonus equal to【SL】to your Accuracy Checks with them.
      At the start of your turn during a conflict, you may choose a weapon Category other than brawling.
      If you do, your unarmed strikes now belong to the chosen Category.
      If you choose bow, firearm or thrown, they become ranged weapons instead of melee.
      If you choose dagger or sword, they cannot be used with Triple Slash.
      These changes last until the start of your next turn.
